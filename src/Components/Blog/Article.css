/* 1.Look for trends. What are the latest trends in technology and society?  What are people talking about? These are all good places to start when looking for a unique app idea.

2.Think outside the box. Don't be afraid to come up with an idea that is completely new and different. The best app ideas are often the ones that no one has thought of before.

3.Do your research. Once you have an idea, it's important to do your research to see if there are already similar apps on the market. If there are, you'll need to find a way to make your app unique.

4.Get feedback. Once you have a prototype of your app, it's important to get feedback from potential users. This will help you to identify any areas that need improvement.*/
